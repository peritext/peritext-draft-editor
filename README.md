Initially inspired by https://github.com/AlastairTaft/draft-js-editor
```

`scholar-draft` aims at providing customizable and easy-to-use components for  building academy-oriented editing apps with `react-js` and [`draft-js`](https://draftjs.org) libraries.

# Goals of `scholar-draft`

This module provides two react editor components that pursue the following main goals :

* easily connect draft's editor [entities](https://draftjs.org/docs/advanced-topics-entities.html#content) to upstream applicationnal logic's assets data in a "one-way binding" manner : **in scholar-draft, entities state and components are entirely handled upstream separately from the editor state**. An entity's data is called an `asset` in the module's vocabulary
* provide callbacks for adding, removing, & editing upstream assets from within the editor's interface
* **allow to insert, move and edit footnotes** within a draft-js editor, while supporting assets as well
* provide three ways to add an asset to the draft : two-step selection, drag-and-drop, inline selection thanks to an input component

To do so, the module provides two components :

* `BasicEditor` : editor without footnotes support
* `Editor` : editor with footnotes support

These components are as "pure" as possible, that is they do not contain their content's state but rather receive it in their props and trigger callbacks when subjected to user's change.

For that reason the module also provides a set of `utils` functions for manipulating editor's state upstream of the editor (Create/Update/Delete operations on contents' notes, Create/Update/Delete operations on contents'  assets, ...). Take a look at the `stories` folder for implementation examples.

# Features

* upstream-connected entities support
* footnotes management & edition support
* assets drag-and-drop support
* block and inline asset wrappers allowing developpers to provide their own assets components (examples : image preview component, video preview component, reference preview component, ...). These components can be provided as plain previews, or can host user interactions and trigger callbacks to change upstream assets.
* asset choice wrapper allowing developpers to provide their own asset selection component (example : an input field enabling to search in the list of relevant assets, ...)
* markdown shortcuts handling
* customizable medium-like contextual toolbar
* customizable style, through css classes selectors
* keyboard shortcuts (default: `@` for inserting an asset, `cmd+^` for inserting a footnote)

# Editor API

## Props

### State-related props

`focusedEditorId` (string) -> 'main', [noteId], or undefined - defines which editor to focus on

`mainEditor` (ImmutableMap) -> the state of the editor of the main object

`notesMap` (Object) -> map of `editorState` maps representing the editors of each map

`notesOrder` (Array<String>) -> order of the notes in the section editor

`assets` (Object) -> map of the assets data to be potentially used by the editor

`assetChoiceProps` (Object) -> props to pass to the component displaying asset choice within the editor

`assetRequestPosition` (ImmutableMap) -> position where asset is requested (if requested)

### Method props [not updated]

`onEditorChange(editorStateId, editorState)` -> if first argument is 'main' will update main editor state, else related note

`onNoteAdd()`

`onNoteDelete(id)`

`onNotePointerMouseOver(noteId, event)`

`onNotePointerMouseOut(noteId, event)`

`onNotesOrderChange(notesOrder)` -> update the note order 

`onAssetRequest(contentType, noteId, selection)` -> triggers when an asset insertion is requested from the editor's ui

`onAssetRequestCancel()`

`onAssetRequestChoice(choice)`

`onAssetClick(assetId, assetData, event)` 

`onAssetMouseOver(assetId, assetData, event)` 

`onAssetMouseOut(assetId, assetData, event)` 

`onDrop(contentId, payload, selection)` 

### Parametrization props

`mainEditorClass` (string) -> the class name to use

`noteEditorClass` (string) -> the class name to use

`mainEditorStyle` (Object) -> a style object

`noteEditorStyle` (Object) -> a style object

`InlineAssetComponents` (Object) -> a map for displaying the inline assets in the editor

`BlockAssetComponents` (Object) -> a map for displaying the block assets in the editor

`AssetChoiceComponent` (ReactComponent) -> the component to use for displaying asset choice in editor (example : an input with a list of possible assets insertion)

`NotePointerComponent`

`NoteContainerComponent`
